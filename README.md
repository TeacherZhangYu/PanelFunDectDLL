# PanelFunDectDLL
This project is an algorithm developed for the automotive center console panel. 
The algorithm mainly includes brightness detection of the screen, color change detection of the screen, 
and character recognition algorithm for the digits on the screen. Additionally, it includes the detection of silk screen printing,
which involves position, consistency, and appearance detection algorithms. 
OpenCV library functions are used to implement some of these algorithms.
